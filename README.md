Description
---
This Cura plugin adds 10 memory slots for user defined camera perspectives. By typing the key
combination `Ctrl + Alt + <number key>` with any `<number key>` 0-9 the current camera perspective,
i.e. position and orientation is stored (in RAM and persistent in the `memory.json` file). Then by
typing `Ctrl + <number key>` with the same `<number key>`, that camera perspective is restored.

*Note:* On macOS as usual the `Cmd` key is used instead of the `Ctrl` key

Supported Platforms

The plugin should work on MacOS, Linux and Windows.
